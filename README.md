#Overview

This repository contains my submission for Course Project in the Practical Machine Learning track on Coursera.

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the people did the exercises, which is defined in the “classe” 
variable in the training dataset. The goal is also describing how the prediction model is built, how it is cross validated, 
evaluation of the expected out of sample error, and explaining the reasons of the choices made to build this model. 
The prediction model will be used to predict 20 different test cases.
